# Intrinsic Time Event Trading Strategy For High Frequency Finance Data

 This project studies the effectiveness of using intrinsic time events when setting up trading strategies on the 'GBPUSD' instrument and backtesting based on the rolling window on each partition of the intrinsic dataframe. The trading strategy below opens a Buy order when the current intrinsic event signal is '2' followed by the '1' intrinsic event signal and when the proportion of the latest '-2' intrinsic events has been greater than 50%. The opposite is for a Sell order with the reverse of the intrinsic event signals. Also, more than one order cannot be placed at the same time based on this strategy. Looking at the histogram distribution of profits/losses of each trade, there is a greater concentration of exit values greater than 0, indicating there were more successful trades than losing trades, and there were no indications of huge wins (outliers) that could have skewed the results.
